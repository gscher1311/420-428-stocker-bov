### Summary & Market Positioning

| Unit Type | Subject Current | Market Range | Suggested Market Rent |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1BR/1BA (~1,650 SF) | $1,895 -- $1,950 | $1,950 -- $2,459 | $2,100 -- $2,300 |
| 2BR/1BA (~1,755 SF) | $1,970 -- $2,630 | $2,470 -- $3,498 | $2,400 -- $2,700 |
| Parking | $15 -- $40 | $50 -- $100 typical | $50 -- $75 |

The subject's units are notably larger than the comps (1,755 SF vs. 1,000 -- 1,200 SF market average), which gives pricing power. However, the subject appears to be older vintage with less renovated finishes compared to 439 Stocker or The Henley. The mid-market comps (550 Stocker, Dryden, 409 Dryden) in the $2,500 -- $2,700 range for 2BR are the most relevant. The subject's current rents on the higher-end units ($2,365 -- $2,630) appear close to market, while several units in the $1,970 -- $2,150 range have upside, and Unit 9 ($900) and Unit 11 ($0) represent significant loss-to-lease.
