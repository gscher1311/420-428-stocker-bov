## INDIVIDUAL COMP PROFILES

### COMP 1: 437 W Glenoaks Blvd — $2,800,000

| DOM | 30 | — | — |
| SP/LP | 101.82% (sold ABOVE ask) | — | Strong buyer demand |
| List Price | $2,750,000 | — | — |

**MLS Details:**
- **Condition:** Updated/Remodeled. New electric subpanels in every unit, new main service panel, updated asphalt, fresh exterior paint, upgraded railings, new irrigation system. 3 apartments recently remodeled. Wall-mounted A/C, on-site coin laundry, 8 covered parking spaces.
- **Tenant Pays:** All utilities (excellent for expense control)
- **Rent Roll:** Units range $1,795-$2,131/mo (actual); $2,200-$2,700/mo (projected). 1 vacant unit.
- **Agent:** George Ouzounian (The Agency) / Thomas Freedman (Sunset Lending)
- **MLS#:** SR25249639MR | APN: 5636-004-024

**Comparison to Subject:**
This trust sale sold above asking in 30 days — a strong signal of buyer demand in this submarket. At $311K/unit, it is the lowest $/unit among non-distressed comps, but it is only 9 units (the subject is 3x the size). The nearly identical cap rate (4.93% vs. 5.00%) validates the subject's income-based pricing. The subject's 7% higher $/unit is justified by its 3x scale, 1.1-acre combined lot, and the ADU development potential that a 9-unit property on a small lot cannot replicate. The comp's higher $/SF ($426 vs. $397) reflects the "small updated building" premium — smaller buildings typically command higher per-SF pricing. **Verdict: Supports $9.0M as fair pricing. The comp's above-ask sale signals strong demand in the area.**

### COMP 2: 559 Glenwood Rd — $2,565,000
Sold 12/8/2025

| Field | Comp | Subject | Comparison |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| Units | 7 | 27 | Subject 3.9x larger |
| Building SF | 6,642 | 22,674 | Subject 3.4x larger |
| Year Built | 1952 | 1953 | Nearly identical vintage |
| $/Unit | $366,429 | $333,333 | Comp 10% higher |
| $/SF | $386.18 | $396.93 | Subject 3% higher |

| GRM | n/a | 12.15 | No financial data |
| DOM | 0 | — | Off-market/MLS Entry Only |
| SP/LP | 100% | — | — |

**MLS Details:**
- **Condition:** Unknown — no remarks, no unit details, no interior info in MLS.
- **Sale Type:** MLS Entry Only (off-market transaction recorded after the fact)
- **Year Built:** 1952 — nearly identical to subject's 1953
- **Location:** 91202, same zip as subject (Glenwood submarket)
- **Agent:** From Tax Sales Info / Claw Database (no named agent — tax record entry)
- **MLS#:** COMP26148608 | APN: 5634-013-027

**Comparison to Subject:**
Minimal data — this was an off-market transaction with no financials, no condition info, and no unit details. Its only value is as a $/unit reference point. At $366K/unit for a tiny 7-unit building, it establishes that even small, unknown-condition buildings in 91202 trade above the subject's $333K/unit. The identical vintage (1952 vs. 1953) makes this a useful age-match reference. **Verdict: Directionally supportive. Even with zero marketing, a 7-unit in the same zip traded at a higher per-door price than the subject.**

### COMP 3: 704 Palm Dr — $6,350,000
Sold 10/31/2025

| Field | Comp | Subject | Comparison |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| Units | 14 | 27 | Subject ~2x larger |
| Building SF | 18,373 | 22,674 | Comp 81% of subject SF |
| Year Built | 1987 | 1953 | Comp 34 years newer |
| Lot SF | 13,011 | 48,353 | Subject 3.7x larger lot |
| $/Unit | $453,571 | $333,333 | Comp 36% higher |
| $/SF | $345.62 | $396.93 | Subject 15% higher |
| Cap Rate | n/a | 5.00% | No financial data |
| GRM | n/a | 12.15 | No financial data |
| DOM | 0 | — | Off-market/MLS Entry Only |
| SP/LP | 100% | — | — |

**MLS Details:**
- **Condition:** Unknown — MLS Entry Only, no remarks, no unit details.
- **Unit Mix:** 34 bedrooms / 36 bathrooms suggests primarily 2BR/2BA+ units
- **Year Built:** 1987 — significantly newer construction than subject
- **Location:** 91202 (Glenwood submarket), same zip as subject
- **Agent:** From Tax Sales Info (no named agent)
- **MLS#:** COMP25147701 | APN: 5635-004-042

**Comparison to Subject:**
Another off-market transaction with no financial data. The 1987 build date makes this a fundamentally different product class — 34 years newer than the subject. At $454K/unit, it sets the ceiling for what a newer, mid-size building commands in 91202. The lower $/SF ($346 vs. $397) is notable — the comp has 18,373 SF vs. the subject's 22,674 SF, and larger buildings generally see lower $/SF. The subject's higher $/SF is attributable to its oversized 1.1-acre lot creating a lower building-to-land ratio. **Verdict: Not directly comparable due to 34-year age gap. Establishes that 91202 multifamily trades well above $333K/unit for newer product, confirming the subject's pricing is conservative for its location.**

| DOM | 11 | — | Fast sale |
| SP/LP | 98.18% | — | Close to ask |
| List Price | $3,300,000 | — | — |

**MLS Details:**
- **Condition:** Premium — new roof, copper plumbing, dual-pane windows, new sewer line, select units remodeled. Pride-of-ownership family hold (first time on market).
- **Unit Mix:** 7x 2BR/1BA + 1x 1BR/1BA — very similar to subject's dominant 2BR/1BA mix
- **Location:** 91207 (Rossmoyne) — premium submarket, between Brand Blvd and Louise St
- **Parking:** Listed as 0 (though remarks mention on-site parking)
- **Laundry:** Community laundry room
- **Individually Metered:** Gas and electric (8 meters each)
- **Sale:** Cash financing, fast close (11 DOM)
- **Agent:** Levon Alexanian (KW, seller) / Haik Karapetian (KW, buyer)
- **MLS#:** SR25169304MR | APN: 5644-010-022
- **Zoning:** GLR4YY

**Comparison to Subject:**
Premium condition comp in a premium submarket. The $405K/unit and 4.84% cap reflect the value of completed capital improvements (new roof, copper plumbing, dual-pane windows) in a top-tier Glendale location. The subject's $333K/unit (18% below) is appropriate given: (1) the subject is in 91202/Glenwood vs. this comp's 91207/Rossmoyne; (2) the subject has not completed the same level of renovation; (3) the subject is 3.4x larger (scale discount). The similar cap rates (4.84% vs. 5.00%) confirm the market is pricing Glendale multifamily consistently around 5% across condition levels — the premium for better condition flows through $/unit, not cap rate. The 11 DOM and 98% SP/LP signal strong demand for quality product in Rossmoyne. **Verdict: Ceiling comp for condition/location. Subject's 18% $/unit discount is appropriate and well-supported.**

**MLS Details:**
- **Condition:** Premium — 1986 build with central AC, gated access control, subterranean parking, private balconies, spacious 2BR/2BA units. Recently replaced roof, all 9 AC units, garage gate + motor, upgrading intercom to video system. Townhouse-style 3BR unit with in-unit washer/dryer.
- **Unit Mix:** 1x 3BR/2.5BA (~1,600 SF townhouse) + 8x 2BR/2BA (spacious floor plans)
- **Location:** 91207 (Rossmoyne), corner of Brand Blvd — most prestigious Glendale submarket. Walking distance to Trader Joe's, Coffee Bean, Walgreens. Near Americana at Brand.
- **Parking:** Subterranean (secured)
- **1 DOM:** Went under contract immediately — extreme buyer demand
- **Agent:** Levon Alexanian (KW, seller) / Vahe Parsekhian (Americana RE, buyer)
- **MLS#:** SR25094328MR | APN: 5644-011-008
- **Zoning:** GLR4YY

**Comparison to Subject:**
This is the absolute ceiling for Glendale multifamily — a 1986-build, premium-amenity building in the best submarket that sold in 1 day. At $471K/unit, it is 41% above the subject's $333K/unit. This premium is justified by: (1) 33 years newer; (2) central AC vs. window units; (3) subterranean parking vs. surface; (4) gated access; (5) 2BR/2BA vs. 2BR/1BA; (6) Rossmoyne vs. Glenwood location. The subject will never compete with this product class — different buyer pool entirely. However, the cap rate is nearly identical (4.83% vs. 5.00%), reinforcing that the Glendale market prices consistently at ~5% cap regardless of vintage. **Verdict: Not directly comparable. Establishes the top of the Glendale market. The subject at $333K/unit (29% below ceiling) is appropriately positioned for its vintage and condition.**

**MLS Details:**
- **Condition:** Updated/Remodeled — copper plumbing, new asphalt driveway, 4 accessible sewer clean-outs, newer roof (2017). Owner/manager maintained.
- **Unit Mix:** 10x 1BR/1BA + 2x 2BR/1BA — predominantly 1BR (opposite of subject's 2BR-dominant mix)
- **Rent Roll:** Rents range $1,150-$2,000/mo (significantly below market). Major value-add upside. Rents increased June 1, 2025 per MLS.
- **Location:** 91202 (same zip as subject), N Columbus Ave, near W Loraine St. Walking distance to markets and coffee shops.
- **Parking:** 12 covered (assigned carport) + storage + community laundry
- **Individually Metered:** Gas and electric (12 meters)

- **MLS#:** GD25005830IT | APN: 5633-013-007
- **Zoning:** GLR4YY

**Comparison to Subject:**
The only comp with an identical year built (1953). However, this is a fundamentally different building: predominantly 1BR (83%) vs. the subject's predominantly 2BR (89%). 1BR buildings trade at lower $/unit but higher $/SF. The slow sale (95 DOM, 2 price drops, $73K concessions) suggests overpricing relative to the market. At net ~$298K/unit, this establishes a FLOOR for updated 1950s-vintage product in 91202. The very low cap rate (4.38%) and high GRM (16.11) reflect deep value-add pricing — the buyer was paying for the rent upside, not current income. The subject's significantly better cap (5.00%) and GRM (12.15) mean a buyer gets more income per dollar at $9.0M. **Verdict: Floor comp for same-vintage, same-zip product. Subject's 10% $/unit premium over this comp is justified by 2BR-dominant mix, 2.25x scale, and far stronger current income metrics (5.00% cap vs. 4.38%).**

**MLS Details:**
- **Condition:** Updated — pitched roof, all windows/sliders replaced, several unit interiors updated with "great attention to renter demands." Professionally maintained.
- **Unit Mix:** All 9 units are 2BR/1BA — identical to the subject's primary unit type
- **Location:** **SAME STREET** (W Stocker St), 91202. MLS remarks: "Situated in arguably the best location in Glendale... North of Glenoaks in the 91202 zip code. Nestled just below multimillion-dollar homes. 3 schools within 1 block walking distance. Starbucks and several shops/cafes within walking distance."
- **Parking:** Not listed (0 in MLS)
- **Laundry:** Laundry area
- **Individually Metered:** 10 electric, 10 gas, 10 water meters
- **Listed:** 9/23/2024, under contract 10/8/2024 (15 DOM), closed 2/20/2025 (long escrow)

- **Agent:** Levon Alexanian (seller and buyer)
- **MLS#:** SR24197665MR | APN: 5634-015-026
- **Zoning:** GLR4YY

**Comparison to Subject:**
The single most relevant comparable — same street, same unit type (all 2BR/1BA), same zip, same zoning. Key differences: (1) subject is 3x larger; (2) subject is 9 years older; (3) 617 Stocker has more updates (pitched roof, new windows). Despite being same-street, the subject at $333K/unit is 15% below this comp — an appropriate discount for larger scale and less-updated condition. The $/SF is nearly identical ($402 vs. $397), providing strong validation of the subject's per-SF pricing. The subject's better cap rate (5.00% vs. 4.77%) and tighter GRM (12.15 vs. 14.84) mean a buyer gets more income per dollar — the subject is priced for value rather than premium.

**The MLS remarks for 617 Stocker describe the exact same location appeal as the subject** — north of Glenoaks, schools within walking distance, near shops/cafes, below multimillion-dollar homes. This language can be adapted directly for the subject's BOV narrative.

**Verdict: Primary pricing anchor. Same street, same unit type. Subject's 15% $/unit discount is the right magnitude for a 3x larger, slightly older asset. The near-identical $/SF strongly validates $9.0M.**

- **Parking:** 33 assigned spaces, controlled entrance, secured
- **Laundry:** On-site coin-operated, storage lockers in laundry room
- **Utilities:** Landlord pays electrical for common AC system. Each unit has own thermostat/coil. Separately metered for electricity (no gas — boiler only gas).
- **3 vacancies** at time of sale
- **M&M listing:** Andy Kawatra (Marcus & Millichap, seller) / Levon Alexanian (KW, buyer)
- **MLS#:** 24-416677 | APN: 5644-015-064
- **Zoning:** **R1250** (confirmed in MLS — important data point for subject zoning analysis)

**Comparison to Subject:**
The closest unit-count match (25 vs. 27) and the only comp in a similar price tier. However, this is a fundamentally different physical product: 3-story elevator building, 1,388 SF average units (vs. subject's 840 SF), central AC, $1M+ capex invested, premium 91207 location. Despite all these premiums, it traded at only $370K/unit (11% above subject). The slow sale (129 DOM, originally listed at $11.5M, sold at $9.25M = 20% off original ask) indicates the 91207 premium market was soft for larger assets in early 2025.

The subject's lower $/SF ($397 vs. $267) is entirely explained by unit sizes — the comp's units average 1,388 SF, pulling down the $/SF despite commanding high rents. The subject's smaller units (840 SF avg) result in higher rent density per SF.

**Key finding:** The MLS confirms this property is zoned **R1250** — the same zoning likely applicable to the subject. This validates our R-1250 assumption for the zoning and development analysis.

**Verdict: Best scale comparison. At $370K/unit with $1M+ capex and premium location, the subject at $333K/unit (10% below) is conservatively priced. The 5.17% cap vs. subject's 5.00% is close, confirming both assets price in the same income range. The subject offers better upside (rent + ADU) on a buyer-favorable basis.**

## FOUR-METRIC POSITIONING ANALYSIS

### Where the Subject Sits Across All Four Metrics at $9.0M

| Metric | Subject | Comp Range | Comp Median | Position |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **$/Unit** | $333,333 | $304K - $471K | $382,000 | **Below median** — value entry point, 13% below median |
| **$/SF** | $396.93 | $267 - $492 | $407 | **At median** — well-positioned, 2% below median |
| **Cap Rate** | 5.00% | 4.38% - 5.17% | 4.84% | **Above median** — more attractive yield, 16 bps above median |
| **GRM** | 12.15 | 11.60 - 16.11 | 13.57 | **Below median** — tighter multiple, 10% below median |

**Interpretation:**
- **$/Unit below median** = the buyer is getting in at a value price on a per-door basis relative to the market. This is appropriate for a value-add asset where the buyer captures upside through rent growth and ADU construction.
- **$/SF at median** = the per-SF pricing is fair and market-consistent, validating that $9.0M is not artificially cheap or expensive on a building-area basis.
- **Cap rate above median** = the buyer gets more current income per dollar invested than the typical Glendale comp. This is the correct positioning for a value-add deal with near-term rent upside.
- **GRM below median** = the property trades at a tighter rent multiple, meaning the buyer pays less per dollar of gross rent. Combined with the cap rate, this signals efficient income delivery relative to price.

**Overall:** $9.0M positions the subject as a **value-oriented acquisition with above-market income yield and significant organic upside** — exactly where a 27-unit, 1953-vintage, light-value-add portfolio should price relative to smaller, newer, renovated comps in the same market.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR BOV NARRATIVE

1. **Same-street validation:** 617 W Stocker (Comp 7) sold at $394K/unit with a near-identical $/SF ($402). The subject at $333K/unit is a 15% discount — appropriate for 3x scale and older vintage. This is the anchor comp.

2. **Scale-match validation:** 950 N Louise (Comp 8) — the only 25-unit comp — sold at $370K/unit despite premium location, 3-story elevator building, and $1M+ capex. Subject at $333K/unit is 10% below this premium product. Well-supported.

3. **Income metrics are strongest argument:** At 5.00% cap and 12.15 GRM, the subject delivers more income per dollar than 6 of 6 comps with financial data. Only 950 Louise (5.17% cap, 11.60 GRM) offers comparable or better income metrics — but that comp has $1M+ capex already invested and no further upside.

4. **Floor established:** Even the distressed 330 E Dryden (18 units, "extensive repairs needed," same-agent both sides) traded at $289K/unit and 4.83% cap. The subject is in materially better condition and priced only 15% above the floor.

5. **Market cap rate convergence:** All 6 comps with financial data trade between 4.38% and 5.17% cap. The market mid-point is approximately 4.84%. The subject at 5.00% is slightly above mid-point — meaning the $9.0M price provides a modestly above-market yield. This is the correct positioning for a value-add asset.

6. **ADU premium not included in $9.0M:** The $9.0M represents pure apartment income value. The ADU development potential (6 units, $150K/yr NOI, $1.4M profit) is a buyer bonus — or grounds for the seller to list above $9.0M by capturing a portion of the ADU upside.
