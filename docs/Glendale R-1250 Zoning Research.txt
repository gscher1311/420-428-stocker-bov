## ZONE CLASSIFICATION

- Assessor Code: GLR4YY
- City Zone: R-1250 (High Density Residential)
- Code Reference: Glendale Municipal Code Title 30, Ch. 30.11, Table 30.11-B
- "GLR4YY" is the LA County Assessor's use code, not the city's official zone label
- Glendale does NOT use "R-4" — its residential zones are: ROS, R1R, R1, R-3050, R-2250, R-1650, R-1250

## ZONE DESCRIPTION (from Code)

"The R-1250 zone is intended primarily as a zone for high-density residential development
with a minimum of 1,250 square feet of lot area per dwelling unit or approved overlay zone
uses, in conformance with the comprehensive general plan of the city. The location of the
R-1250 zone is based on convenience, adequacy of services, traffic circulation and the
existence of open space and recreation areas that support the concentration of population
in such zones."

## R-1250 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS (Table 30.11-B)

### Density
- Standard: 1 dwelling unit per 1,250 SF of lot area
- Wide-lot bonus: 1 dwelling unit per 1,000 SF on lots with width ≥90 feet

### Subject Property Density Analysis
- 420 lot: 24,187 SF / 1,250 = 19 units max (no wide-lot bonus at 80 ft width)
- 428 lot: 24,166 SF / 1,250 = 19 units max
- Combined: 48,353 SF / 1,250 = 38 units max
- Existing: 27 units = COMPLIANT (11 units of headroom)

### Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
- Maximum: 1.2
- Subject: 22,674 SF / 48,353 SF = 0.47 FAR (well under limit)
- Max buildable: 48,353 x 1.2 = 58,024 SF (35,350 SF of headroom)

### Height
- Standard: 3 stories / 36 feet maximum
- Lots ≤90 ft wide: 2 stories / 26 feet maximum
- +5 ft allowed for roofed areas with minimum 3:12 pitch
- Subject lots are ~80 ft wide each = 2-story / 26 ft limit applies

### Lot Coverage
- 50% maximum (including all residential and accessory buildings)

### Setbacks
- Street Front: 20 ft minimum, avg 23 ft for garage/first floor; 23 ft min, avg 26 ft for 2nd/3rd floor
- Street Side: 5 ft min, avg 8 ft (first floor); 8 ft min, avg 11 ft (second floor); 11 ft min, avg 14 ft (third floor)
- Interior: 5 ft min, avg 8 ft (first floor); 8 ft min, avg 11 ft (second floor)
- Interior abutting ROS/R1R/R1: 8 ft min, avg 11 ft (first floor), wider for upper floors

### Open Space & Outdoor Space
- Permanently Landscaped Open Space: 25% of lot area minimum
- Private Outdoor Space: 40 SF minimum per unit (patio, deck, or balcony with 4 ft min dimension)
- Common Outdoor Space: 200 SF per unit (first 25 units), 150 SF per unit (next 25 units)
  - Subject: (25 x 200) + (2 x 150) = 5,300 SF required
  - Must have 10 ft min level surface dimension and 200 SF min area
  - No street front or street side setback area counts

### Minimum Dwelling Unit Size
- Efficiency / 1BR: 600 SF
- 2BR: 800 SF
- 3BR+: 1,000 SF
- NOTE: Subject units at 650-750 SF may be below current minimums — likely legal nonconforming

### Laundry Facilities
- Required for all dwelling units on a lot
- >3 units: common laundry room with at least 1 washer + 1 dryer per 10 units
- Must be accessible 7:00 AM - 10:00 PM daily

### Storage
- 90 cubic feet of private storage per unit (outside the unit) unless private garage provided
- 24 SF minimum horizontal surface, fully enclosed and lockable

### Distance Between Buildings
- Exterior walls of separate buildings: 12 ft minimum separation
- Windows facing windows: 12+ ft unless angle ≥90 degrees

### Elevator Requirement
- Required when building has >3 units and floor area on 3rd story only + units on 1st/2nd stories

### Parking
- Per Chapter 30.32 (not extracted — need to look up specific requirements)

### Design Review
- Per Chapter 30.47

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR BOV

1. R-1250 is Glendale's HIGHEST density residential zone
2. Property is well within all density and FAR limits — significant upzoning/development headroom
3. At 80 ft lot width, each lot is below the 90 ft threshold for the wide-lot density bonus
4. Current 27 units vs 38 allowed = 11 units of headroom
5. Current 0.47 FAR vs 1.2 allowed = potential for ~35K additional SF
6. Height limit of 26 ft / 2 stories for lots ≤90 ft wide (not 36 ft / 3 stories)
7. Unit sizes may be legal nonconforming (below current minimums)
8. Glendale is NOT City of LA — no ZIMAS, no RSO, no TOC, no Measure ULA
