## DOES GLENDALE HAVE RENT CONTROL?

Glendale does NOT impose its own rent increase cap. The City's Rental Rights Program (Ord. #5922) does NOT set a separate cap — California's statewide AB 1482 (Tenant Protection Act) is the governing rent increase limit.

## AB 1482 (STATE LAW — PRIMARY RENT CONTROL)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Law | AB 1482 / California Tenant Protection Act of 2019 |
| Effective Through | January 1, 2030 |
| Annual Rent Increase Cap | 5% + regional CPI (LA metro area, April-to-April), maximum 10% |
| Recent Cap Example | ~8.8% (5% + 3.8% CPI) |
| Just Cause Eviction | Yes — required for tenancies >12 months |
| Notice Requirements | 30 days for increases <10%; 90 days for increases ≥10% |
| Applies to Subject? | YES — built 1953/1954, 70+ years old, multifamily |

### AB 1482 Exemptions (NOT applicable to subject)
- Units with Certificate of Occupancy within last 15 years
- Single-family homes / condos owned by individuals (not corporate entities)
- Owner-occupied duplexes
- Many affordable housing units

## GLENDALE LOCAL RULES (ORD. #5922 — RENTAL RIGHTS PROGRAM)

| Provision | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Relocation Payments | Triggered when rent increase exceeds 7% in a 12-month period |
| Lease Requirement | Landlord must offer a written minimum 12-month lease at time of rent increase |
| Rent Rollback | Rent rollback and notice rules apply for covered units |
| Rent Increase Cap | No separate city cap — AB 1482's state cap controls |
| Local Exemptions | Units built after Feb 1, 1995 for some local provisions (but AB 1482 still applies) |

### Relocation Payment Detail
- If landlord raises rent >7% in 12 months, must provide relocation assistance
- This is a PRACTICAL CONSTRAINT on aggressive rent increases
- Even if AB 1482 allows 8.8%, Glendale's relocation trigger at 7% means:
  - Increases up to 7%: no relocation payment required
  - Increases above 7%: must pay relocation assistance (amount TBD — check current schedule)

## PRACTICAL IMPACT ON SUBJECT PROPERTY

| Scenario | Analysis |
|----------|----------|
| All 27 units are covered | Built 1953/1954, multifamily, well over 15 years old |
| Maximum annual increase | ~8.8% (5% + CPI), but triggers relocation payment above 7% |
| Recommended approach | Push rents up to 7% annually without triggering relocation; achieve market in 2-3 years |
| Below-market units | Unit 428-9 ($900), Unit 428-11 ($0 — owner's son): vacancy/turnover path to market rent |
| Vacancy decontrol | When a unit is vacated, landlord can reset to market rent (no cap on initial rent for new tenants) |

## KEY POINTS FOR BOV

1. Glendale is NOT rent-controlled in the traditional sense — no city rent board, no registration
2. AB 1482 is the rent increase cap: 5% + CPI (max 10%)
3. Glendale's Ord. #5922 adds relocation payments above 7% increase — practical cap is 7%
4. Vacancy decontrol: biggest upside comes from natural turnover to market rent
5. Just cause eviction applies — cannot terminate tenancies without cause after 12 months
6. Must offer written 12-month lease with any rent increase
7. All 27 units at the subject property are covered by both AB 1482 and local program
