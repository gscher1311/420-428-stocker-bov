## SECTION 8: Zoning & Land Use

| Field | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Zoning | GLR4YY (= **R-1250 High Density Residential**) | Assessor, MLS, Glendale Municipal Code |
| Jurisdiction | City of Glendale | — |
| Land Use | Apartment house (5+ units) | Assessor |
| General Plan | High Density Residential | Glendale Municipal Code Title 30 |

### Glendale R-1250 Zone Development Standards (Title 30, Ch. 30.11)

| Standard | R-1250 Requirement | Subject Property |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Density** | 1 DU per 1,250 SF lot area (1 per 1,000 SF on lots ≥90 ft wide) | 48,353 SF ÷ 1,250 = **38 units max** (or 48 at higher density) — 27 existing = **compliant** |
| **FAR** | 1.2 maximum | 22,674 SF ÷ 48,353 SF = **0.47 FAR** — well under limit |
| **Max Buildable SF** | FAR x Lot | 48,353 x 1.2 = **58,024 SF** (35K+ SF headroom) |
| **Height** | 3 stories / 36 ft (2 stories / 26 ft on lots ≤90 ft wide) | Likely 2 stories — **compliant** |
| **Lot Coverage** | 50% max | TBD — likely compliant |
| **Min Unit Size** | 1BR: 600 SF, 2BR: 800 SF, 3BR+: 1,000 SF | Units at 650-750 SF may be legal nonconforming |
| **Landscaped Open Space** | 25% min of lot area | TBD |
| **Common Outdoor Space** | 200 SF/unit (first 25), 150 SF/unit (next 25) | ~5,130 SF required |
| **Private Outdoor Space** | 40 SF min per unit | TBD |
| **Laundry** | 1 washer + 1 dryer per 10 units in common room | Need to verify on-site |
| **Parking** | Per Chapter 30.32 | TBD |
| **Setbacks** | Front: 20 ft min; Side: 5 ft min/8 ft avg | Existing — likely legal nonconforming |

**Key Takeaways:**
- GLR4YY = Glendale's R-1250 zone (High Density Residential)
- Glendale is NOT City of LA — no ZIMAS, no RSO, no TOC
- **Significant development potential:** Current FAR 0.47 vs 1.2 allowed = ~35K SF additional buildable area
- **Density headroom:** 27 units out of 38-48 allowed = room for 11-21 additional units
- Unit sizes (650-750 SF) may be below current minimums — likely legal nonconforming as pre-existing

## SECTION 9: Regulatory & Compliance

### Rent Control Status

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| City | Glendale | NOT City of Los Angeles |
| RSO Status | **Not applicable** | RSO is LA City only |
| State Law (AB 1482) | **Applies** | Built before 2005, 15+ years old, through 2030 |
| AB 1482 Rent Increase Cap | **5% + regional CPI** (LA metro, Apr-Apr), max 10% | ~8.8% in recent years (5% + 3.8% CPI) |
| Just Cause Eviction | **Yes** | AB 1482 applies |
| Glendale Local Ordinance | **Ord. #5922 (Rental Rights Program)** | No separate rent cap beyond AB 1482 |
| Relocation Payments | **Triggered if >7% increase in 12 months** | Per Glendale Ord. #5922 |
| Lease Requirement | **Must offer written 12-month lease** at time of rent increase | Per Glendale Ord. #5922 |
| Notice Requirements | 30 days for increases <10%, 90 days for ≥10% | AB 1482 |

**Key Points:**
- Glendale does NOT impose its own rent increase cap — AB 1482's state cap controls
- However, Glendale's Rental Rights Program (Ord. #5922) adds requirements:
  - Relocation payments triggered when rent increase exceeds 7% in a 12-month period
  - Landlords must offer a written minimum 12-month lease
  - Rent-rollback and notice rules apply for covered units
- AB 1482 exemptions: units with Certificate of Occupancy within last 15 years, owner-occupied duplexes, single-family homes (not corporate-owned)
- Local program exemptions: units built after Feb 1, 1995 for some local rules (but AB 1482 still applies)
- **Subject property: All 27 units are covered by AB 1482** (built 1953/1954, 70+ years old)
- The 7% relocation trigger is a practical constraint on aggressive rent increases

### Building Code Compliance

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Soft-Story Retrofit | **Not mandatory** | Glendale does NOT have a mandatory soft-story retrofit ordinance (voluntary as of May 2019) |
| Seismic | Standard CA requirements | No special Glendale seismic retrofit mandate for this property type |
| SB 326 (Balcony) | TBD | If applicable — exterior elevated elements inspection |
| Certificate of Occupancy | TBD | No open violations found in permit search |
| Open Violations | **None found** | Glendale B&S permit portal shows no open code enforcement cases |

**Note:** While Glendale does not mandate soft-story retrofits, 1953/1954 wood-frame buildings with tuck-under parking (if present) would still be seismically vulnerable. A buyer should evaluate voluntarily. LA has a mandatory program, but Glendale does not.

- INSP-089853-2024 — Final Building — **Passed** (05/06/2024)

### Permit Analysis Notes

1. **Roofing:** Both parcels have had roof work. 420 was reroofed in 2012 (front house + garage). 428 was reroofed in 2007. A 2024 permit for 420 (40 sqs) expired without final — **need to verify if work was completed**
2. **Plumbing repipe:** 420 was repiped in 2005 (Units A-H). 428 had plumbing work (vents/valves) in 2004. **No full repipe permit found for 428** — buyer should verify plumbing condition
3. **Walkway/stucco repair (428):** Recent 2023-2024 work finalized — this aligns with the seller's 2024 CapEx for deck work ($28,500 + $10,044)
4. **No soft-story retrofit permits found** for either parcel (Glendale doesn't mandate)
5. **No permits found for:** the 2024 window work ($10,700), HVAC repairs ($4,500), or major plumbing/electrical ($25K+$18K) reported in seller's CapEx. **Some of this work may have been done without permits or under maintenance exemptions**
6. **No unit addition or conversion permits found** — the existing unit count appears original

## SECTION 15: DEBT & TAX REASSESSMENT ANALYSIS

### Current Debt

| Loan | Property | Lender | Amount | Date | Type |
|------|----------|--------|--------|------|------|
| 1 | 420 Stocker | Chase | $1,350,000 | 4/22/2022 | Variable/Commercial |
| 2 | 428 Stocker | Chase | $250,000 | 4/22/2022 | Commercial |
| **Total** | | | **$1,600,000** | | |

### Prop 13 Tax Reassessment Impact

| Metric | Seller Current | Model (at $9.15M) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Assessed Value | $4,238,666 | ~$9,150,000 |
| Annual Taxes | $49,300 | **$103,395** |
| Tax Increase | — | **+$54,095/yr** |

**The pricing model correctly accounts for reassessment.** The $103,395 tax figure is the single largest expense adjustment from seller's actuals (+$54K/yr). This is baked into both the current and pro forma NOI in the model.

### Front House Rent Estimate

**4BR SFR Comps in 91202 (North Glendale):**

| Address | BR/BA | SF | Rent | $/SF | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----|------|------|-------|
| 1412 Norton Ave | 4/4 | 2,675 | $6,800 | $2.54 | 1932 Spanish, pool, hardwood, fireplace |
| 914 Patterson Ave | 4/2 | 1,856 | $5,500 | $2.96 | 1948 traditional, updated, yard |
| 369 W Kenneth Rd | 4/3 | 2,557 | $7,500 | $2.93 | Near Kenneth Village, gourmet kitchen |

**Discount for multifamily lot:** A front house on a 27-unit apartment property is NOT comparable to a standalone SFR. Shared parking, foot traffic, less privacy, apartment-complex feel. Apply 15-25% haircut to SFR comps.

**Historical context:** Listed at $3,850-$3,900/mo in 2009 and **expired without leasing** -- the multifamily-lot discount was already a factor. Adjusting for ~35-50% Glendale rent growth since 2009 on a realistic 2009 achievable rent of ~$3,500 yields $4,725-$5,250 today.

**Conservative underwriting rent: $4,500/mo ($54,000/yr)**
**Pricing model uses: $5,000/mo ($60,000/yr)**

### 1. Legal Framework: SB 1211 (Effective January 1, 2025)

**California Senate Bill 1211** (signed September 19, 2024, effective January 1, 2025) expanded ADU rights on multifamily properties, increasing the detached ADU cap from 2 to **8 per lot**. This is a by-right, ministerial (non-discretionary) approval — no hearing, no CEQA, 60-day approval timeline.

| Provision | Detail | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Detached ADUs per lot | Up to **8** (cannot exceed existing unit count on parcel) | SB 1211; Gov. Code §66323(a)(4) |
| Conversion ADUs (interior) | Up to **25% of existing units** (from non-livable space) | Gov. Code §66323(a)(3) |
| Size per ADU | 850 SF min (studio/1BR) or 1,000 SF (2+ BR); up to 1,200 SF max | Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(B) |
| Height | **18 ft max** (on lot with existing multistory multifamily) | Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(D)(iii) |
| Stories | **2 stories allowed** (18 ft = 9 ft/floor × 2) | State law; not restricted to 1 story |
| Setbacks from lot lines | **4 ft** side and rear | Gov. Code §66323(a)(4) |
| Building separation (ADU to existing) | **~6 ft min** (CA Building Code fire separation for Type V wood frame) | CBC Table 602; may be reduced with fire-rated walls |
| Building separation (ADU to ADU) | **~6 ft min** between separate detached structures | CBC Table 602 |
| Each ADU must be detached | Yes — detached from the **existing multifamily building** (separate structures) | SB 1211 legislative text |
| Parking replacement | **Not required** — no replacement parking when demolishing surface parking for ADUs | SB 1211; Gov. Code §66323(a)(4)(B) |
| Approval process | Ministerial (by right) — **60-day approval** | Gov. Code §66321(a)(3) |
| Impact fees | ADUs <750 SF exempt; larger ADUs proportional only | Gov. Code §66323(f)(3) |
| Owner occupancy | **Not required** (eliminated by AB 976, effective 2025) | Gov. Code §66321(a)(8) |
| Short-term rental | Must be rented for terms of **30+ days** | Gov. Code §66323(a)(6) |

### 2. Legal ADU Allowance (Two Separate Parcels)

Since 420 and 428 W Stocker are **separate legal parcels** with separate APNs, each parcel receives its own SB 1211 allowance:

| | 420 W Stocker (APN 5636-001-020) | 428 W Stocker (APN 5636-001-021) | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| Existing Units | 9 (house + 8 apts) | 18 | **27** |
| Lot Size (SF) | 24,187 (80 ft × 300 ft) | 24,166 (80 ft × 300 ft) | **48,353** |
| **Detached ADU Cap** | **8** (≤ 9 existing) | **8** (≤ 18 existing) | **16** |
| **Conversion ADU Cap** | **2** (25% × 9 = 2.25) | **4** (25% × 18 = 4.5) | **6** |
| **Total Legal Max ADUs** | **10** | **12** | **22** |

### 3. Physical Site Analysis: Rear Parking Area

**Gross Dimensions (from GIS aerial measurement):**
- Rear parking area: **~50 ft deep × 160 ft wide = ~8,000 SF**
- Located at the back of both lots, farthest from W Stocker St street frontage
- Currently used as surface parking for both buildings

**Setback Deductions:**

| Setback | Distance | From | Source |
|---------|----------|------|--------|
| Rear property line | 4 ft | Back (east) edge | State ADU law — 4 ft max for detached ADUs |
| Exterior side setback (north edge, 428 parcel) | 4 ft | North property line | State ADU law |
| Exterior side setback (south edge, 420 parcel) | 4 ft | South property line | State ADU law |
| Interior lot line (between 420 & 428) | 4 ft × 2 sides = 8 ft gap | Lot line between parcels | State ADU law (4 ft each side) |
| Separation from existing buildings | ~6 ft | West edge (facing existing apartments) | CA Building Code fire separation, Type V construction |

**Net Buildable Area Per Parcel:**
- Width: 80 ft - 4 ft (exterior side) - 4 ft (interior lot line) = **72 ft**
- Depth: 50 ft - 4 ft (rear setback) - 6 ft (building separation from existing) = **40 ft**
- **Per-parcel buildable: 72 ft × 40 ft = 2,880 SF**

**Combined buildable: ~5,760 SF** (two parcels of 2,880 SF each, with 8 ft gap between them at the interior lot line)

### 4. ADU Layout Feasibility (Per Parcel)

**ADU building dimensions (2-story, ~880 SF each):**
- Footprint: 20 ft wide × 22 ft deep = 440 SF per floor × 2 stories = **880 SF total**
- This yields a 2BR/1BA or large 1BR/1BA unit with modern finishes
- Height: 18 ft (within state law limit for multistory multifamily lots)

**Fitting ADUs within 72 ft width:**
- Each building: 20 ft wide
- Fire separation between buildings: 6 ft
- Layout: 20 ft + 6 ft + 20 ft + 6 ft + 20 ft = **72 ft** (exact fit)
- **Result: 3 detached ADU buildings per parcel**

**Depth check:**
- Building depth: 22 ft
- Remaining: 40 ft - 22 ft = **18 ft** for rear walkway/access/landscaping ✓
- Fire access path width: 18 ft exceeds minimum 5 ft requirement ✓

**Site note from permit records:** 420 parcel has 1 **coast live oak tree** (protected under Glendale Indigenous Tree Ordinance, permit BITO1506586). ADU placement on the 420 side should avoid the tree's root zone/canopy. If the oak is in the parking area, it may reduce the buildable footprint on the 420 parcel by one ADU position. Verify tree location on site visit.

**Combined layout: 6 detached ADUs total (3 per parcel)**

| Item | Per Parcel | Combined |
|------|-----------|----------|
| ADU buildings | 3 | **6** |
| Stories | 2 | 2 |
| SF per ADU | ~880 SF | — |
| Building footprint each | 20 ft × 22 ft (440 SF) | — |
| Total new building area | 2,640 SF | **5,280 SF** |
| Remaining open space | ~1,560 SF per parcel | ~3,120 SF |

### 5. Height & Stories Confirmation

| Question | Answer | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Can ADUs be 2 stories? | **Yes** | Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(D)(iii): 18 ft height allowed on lots with existing multistory multifamily |
| What is 18 ft in stories? | **2 stories** (9 ft floor-to-floor × 2 = 18 ft) | Standard residential construction |
| Does Glendale restrict to 1 story? | **No — state law preempts.** Glendale's 16 ft ADU limit is overridden by state's 18 ft for multistory MF lots | Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(D)(iii) preempts local ordinance |
| Does the 80 ft lot width matter? | **Not for ADUs.** The 80 ft < 90 ft threshold affects conventional zoning density/height, but ADU height is governed by state law (18 ft), not local zoning height limits | State preemption |

### 6. ADU Revenue & Rent Projections

**ADU rent estimate:** New-construction 2-story ADUs (880 SF, 2BR/1BA or large 1BR/1BA) with modern finishes in prime North Glendale 91202 would command a premium over the existing 1950s-era apartments.

| Comp Basis | Rent Range | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Subject 2BR existing (750 SF) | $2,400-$2,650 | 1950s vintage, unrenovated |
| 550 W Stocker renovated 2BR | $2,595-$2,695 | Same street, renovated |
| 618 W Dryden updated 2BR | $2,550-$2,650 | 1 block north, updated |
| 409 W Dryden 2BR/2BA | $2,470-$2,800 | Updated kitchens |
| **ADU estimate (new construction, 880 SF)** | **$2,500-$2,800** | New build premium, modern finishes, but smaller SF |

**Conservative ADU rent used for projections: $2,500/mo** (at the low end of new-construction range, accounting for smaller size and ADU market positioning)

| Metric | 6 ADUs (Feasible Estimate) |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Monthly Rent (6 × $2,500) | **$15,000** |
| Annual Gross Rent | **$180,000** |
| Less: Vacancy (5%) | ($9,000) |
| Less: Operating Expenses (~$3,500/unit/yr) | ($21,000) |
| **ADU Net Operating Income** | **$150,000** |

### 7. Construction Cost Estimate

| Cost Component | Per ADU (880 SF) | 6 ADUs Total |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Hard costs ($250/SF avg) | $220,000 | $1,320,000 |
| Soft costs (15%: permits, arch, eng, fees) | $33,000 | $198,000 |
| Site work (demo parking, grading, utilities) | $15,000 | $90,000 |
| **Total estimated cost** | **$268,000** | **$1,608,000** |

**Cost range:** $225,000-$325,000 per ADU depending on finish level and contractor. Total project: **$1.35M-$1.95M** for 6 units.

**Timeline:** 6-9 months permitting + 6-9 months construction = **12-18 months** from application to occupancy.

### 8. ADU Value Creation & Profit Analysis

**Value creation at stabilization (all 6 ADUs leased):**

| Valuation Method | Calculation | Value Created |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Cap Rate (5.0%) | $150,000 NOI / 0.050 | **$3,000,000** |
| Cap Rate (4.75%) | $150,000 / 0.0475 | **$3,158,000** |
| GRM (15.0×) | $180,000 gross × 15.0 | **$2,700,000** |
| $/Unit ($339K, matching subject pricing) | 6 × $339,000 | **$2,034,000** |

**Profit analysis:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|

## GROUND-UP DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL: A REALITY CHECK

*This section is designed for the BOV as a standalone analysis addressing the "land value" question head-on with sourced data and logic.*

### Zoning Capacity

The LA County Assessor codes this property as "GLR4YY" — an assessor use code, not the Glendale zoning designation. Glendale's highest-density residential zone is **R-1250** (1 unit per 1,250 SF of lot area). Based on the property's existing density, it is most likely zoned R-1250 or R-1650. *(ACTION: Confirm via Glendale Interactive Zoning Map or call (818) 548-2140.)*

**Maximum density under Glendale zoning (lots 80 ft wide — standard density only):**

| Zoning | Density Rule | Max Units (combined 48,353 SF) | Existing | Net Gain |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| **R-1250** | 1 DU / 1,250 SF | **38** | 27 | **+11** |
| **R-1650** | 1 DU / 1,650 SF | **28** | 27 | **+1** |

*Source: Glendale Municipal Code §30.11.030, Table 30.11-B. Wide-lot bonus (≥90 ft) does NOT apply — each lot is 80 ft wide.*

**Development standards (R-1250, conventional new construction):**

| Standard | Limit | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Height** | **2 stories / 26 ft** (lots ≤90 ft wide) | GMC §30.11.030 Table 30.11-B, note (4)/(5) |
| **FAR** | 1.2 max (58,024 SF) | GMC §30.11.030 |
| **Lot Coverage** | 50% max | GMC §30.11.030 |
| **Open Space** | 25% min permanently landscaped | GMC §30.11.030 |
| **Common Outdoor** | 200 SF/unit (first 25 units), 150 SF/unit (next 25) | GMC §30.11.050(C) |
| **Min Unit Size** | 600 SF (1BR), 800 SF (2BR), 1,000 SF (3BR) | GMC §30.11.050(A) |

**The fundamental problem: a developer would tear down 27 units to build only 38.** That is a net gain of 11 units. No rational developer would demolish a stabilized, income-producing 27-unit portfolio for 11 additional units.

### The Economics of Demolition & Rebuild

Even assuming R-1250 zoning and a 38-unit ground-up project, the numbers do not work:

**Cost to build (RAND Corporation, April 2025):**

| Cost Component | Amount | Source |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Land basis (asking price) | $9,150,000 | Pricing model |
| Demolition (27 units, 22,674 SF) | ~$200,000 | Industry estimate |
| Hard construction (38 units × $430K avg) | $16,340,000 | RAND 2025: CA market-rate avg ~$430K/unit |
| Soft costs (architecture, engineering, permits — 25%) | $4,085,000 | RAND 2025: soft costs ~25-30% of hard |
| Municipal development/impact fees (38 × $29K) | $1,102,000 | RAND 2025: CA avg ~$29K/unit |
| Tenant relocation (27 units × 3 mo rent) | ~$186,000 | Glendale Ord. 5922 formula |
| Lost rental income during construction (4 yrs × $460K NOI) | $1,840,000 | Current NOI |
| Financing/carry costs (~5% of hard costs × 3 yr) | ~$2,450,000 | Estimated |
| **Total all-in development cost** | **~$35,350,000** | |

*Primary source: Ward, Jason M. & Schlake, Matias R., "The High Cost of Producing Multifamily Housing in California," RAND Corporation, RR-A3743-1, April 2025. Key finding: California's average market-rate multifamily production cost is ~$430,000/unit — 2.5× Texas and nearly 2× Colorado. Los Angeles metro is among the most expensive submarkets in California. Development timelines in CA average 22+ months longer than comparable projects in Texas.*

**Completed value of a new 38-unit building:**

| Metric | Calculation | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Market rent (new construction) | 38 units × $3,250/mo × 12 | $1,482,000 gross |
| Vacancy (5%) | | ($74,100) |
| Operating expenses (35%) | | ($518,700) |
| **Stabilized NOI** | | **$889,200** |
| **Value at 4.5% cap** | $889,200 / 0.045 | **$19,760,000** |
| **Value at 4.0% cap** | $889,200 / 0.040 | **$22,230,000** |

**The gap: A developer would spend ~$35.4M to create a property worth $19.8-$22.2M.** That is a **loss of $13-$16 million.** No developer would pursue this project.

### Legal & Regulatory Barriers to Demolition

Beyond the economics, California and Glendale law create significant barriers:

**1. SB 330 — Housing Crisis Act (Gov. Code §66300 et seq.)**
- **No net loss of units:** A developer cannot reduce the number of residential units on the site. All 27 demolished units must be replaced. *(Gov. Code §66300(d)(2))*
- **Protected units must be replaced at the same affordability level.** If tenants are lower-income (which several likely are given rents of $900-$2,050), replacement units must be deed-restricted affordable. *(Gov. Code §66300(d)(2)(B))*
- **Displaced tenants must receive relocation assistance** and a right of first refusal to return. *(Gov. Code §66300(d)(2)(D))*
- **No demolition permit issued** until replacement and relocation agreements are executed and recorded. *(ABAG Guide to State Replacement Housing Requirements, May 2025)*

**2. Ellis Act Constraints (Gov. Code §7060 et seq., as amended by AB 1399)**
- If the owner withdraws the property from the rental market (Ellis Act), **the withdrawal date is the latest termination date of any unit** — meaning all 27 units must be simultaneously vacated. *(AB 1399, effective Jan. 1, 2020)*
- If **any unit is re-rented** during the constraint period, the **entire property must be returned to the rental market** at prior rents. *(AB 1399, Gov. Code §7060.2(b))*
- **Punitive damages do not extinguish the obligation** to re-offer units to displaced tenants. *(AB 1399)*
- Glendale implements these protections through its Rental Rights Program and Just Cause Eviction ordinance. *(Glendale Ord. 5922)*

**3. Glendale Tenant Protections (Ordinance 5922, updated 2024)**
- **Just Cause Eviction required** for all covered units (built on or before Feb 1, 1995 — both buildings qualify as 1953/1954 construction). *(Glendale Ord. 5922, §9.30.025)*
- **Relocation assistance:** 3 months' rent payable to each displaced tenant. At average rents of ~$2,300/mo: **$6,900 per unit × 27 = ~$186,000 minimum.** *(Glendale Rent-Based Termination Calculator, glendalerentalrights.com)*
- **12-month lease offer required** before any rent increase. *(Glendale Ord. 5922)*
- **Demolition as just cause** requires that the work cost at least 8× monthly rent and render the unit uninhabitable for >30 days. *(Glendale Ord. 5922, §9.30.025(B)(4))*

**4. CEQA & Design Review**
- A 38-unit ground-up project in Glendale would likely require environmental review under CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act) unless the project qualifies for a categorical exemption or streamlined review under SB 423.
- Glendale's Design Review process (GMC Chapter 30.47) adds discretionary review, additional time, and the risk of public opposition.

**5. SB 423 Streamlining — Limited Applicability**
SB 423 (effective Jan 1, 2024) extends SB 35's ministerial approval for qualifying multifamily projects, but **requires affordable housing set-asides** (below-market units with 55-year deed restrictions for rentals). Even if the project qualifies, the economics above remain upside down. *(SB 423, Stats. 2023, Ch. 778)*

### Why "Land Value" Does Not Support a Higher Price

The seller's belief that a developer would pay a premium for the "land" relies on a flawed assumption: that the underlying land is worth more than the existing improvements. In reality:

1. **If the land is worth more as a development site, the improvements have negative value.** A developer pricing the land for redevelopment would SUBTRACT the cost of demolition, tenant relocation, lost income, and entitlement risk from the land value — arguing for a LOWER price, not higher.

2. **The zoning limits the upside.** At 80 ft lot width, the property is capped at 2 stories / 26 ft and ~38 units. A developer gains only 11 net units for $26M+ in construction costs. The math produces a $13-16M loss.

3. **The highest and best use is the existing use + ADU infill.** The property generates $460K/yr NOI today and has $138K/yr of rent upside plus $150K/yr of ADU income potential — all achievable without demolishing a single unit.

4. **Developer demand for tear-down multifamily in Glendale is effectively zero** given AB 1399 (Ellis Act), SB 330 (no net loss), Glendale Ord. 5922 (just cause + relocation), construction costs ($430K+/unit per RAND), and the 2-story height limit.

**Bottom line for the BOV:** The development potential is theoretical, not practical. It provides long-term optionality only — perhaps relevant in a future regulatory/market environment, but it contributes zero premium to the current asking price. The real value-add is ADUs.

## ADU DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY — SB 1211 ANALYSIS

*This section is designed as a standalone BOV section with the aerial images at top, followed by legal framework, feasibility analysis, and financial projections.*

### BOV Presentation Notes

**Images to include at top of this section:**
1. **Lot dimensions aerial** — Blue outline (300 ft × 160 ft combined property) with yellow ADU zone (50 ft × 160 ft at rear)
2. **Parking area closeup** — Red-highlighted rear parking labeled "50 Feet x 160 Feet"

### Part A: Legal Framework & Maximum ADU Potential

**California Senate Bill 1211** (signed Sept. 19, 2024; effective Jan. 1, 2025) expanded ADU rights on multifamily properties, increasing the detached ADU cap from 2 to **8 per lot**.

| Provision | Rule | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Detached ADUs per lot | Up to **8** (capped at existing unit count) | SB 1211; Gov. Code §66323(a)(4) |
| Conversion ADUs (interior) | Up to **25% of existing units** (non-livable space) | Gov. Code §66323(a)(3) |
| Max size per ADU | 850 SF (studio/1BR) to 1,200 SF (detached) | Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(B) |
| Height | **18 ft** (on lots with existing multistory multifamily) | Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(D)(iii) |
| Stories | **2 stories** (9 ft/floor × 2 = 18 ft) | State law; preempts local limits |
| Setbacks from lot lines | **4 ft** side and rear | Gov. Code §66323(a)(4) |
| Building separation (fire) | **~6 ft** between structures (CA Building Code) | CBC Table 602, Type V construction |
| Parking replacement | **Not required** | SB 1211; Gov. Code §66323(a)(4)(B) |
| Approval | **Ministerial (by right)** — 60-day timeline | Gov. Code §66321(a)(3) |
| Owner occupancy | **Not required** | AB 976 (effective 2025) |
| Impact fees | ADUs <750 SF exempt; larger proportional only | Gov. Code §66323(f)(3) |

**Mathematical maximum — two separate parcels:**

| | 420 Parcel (9 existing units) | 428 Parcel (18 existing units) | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detached ADU cap | **8** (≤ 9 existing) | **8** (≤ 18 existing) | **16** |
| Conversion ADU cap | **2** (25% of 9) | **4** (25% of 18) | **6** |
| **Legal maximum** | **10** | **12** | **22** |

### Part B: Physical Feasibility — What Can Actually Be Built

**Site dimensions (rear parking area):**
- Gross area: **50 ft deep × 160 ft wide = ~8,000 SF** (confirmed via GIS aerial measurement)
- Currently surface parking for both buildings

**Setback deductions (per parcel, 80 ft wide):**

| Setback | Distance | Applied to | Source |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Rear property line | 4 ft | Back edge | State ADU law |
| Exterior side property line | 4 ft | North or south edge | State ADU law |
| Interior lot line (between 420 & 428) | 4 ft each side = 8 ft gap | Middle | State ADU law |
| Separation from existing buildings | ~6 ft | Front edge (toward apartments) | CA Building Code fire separation |

**Net buildable per parcel: 72 ft wide × 40 ft deep = 2,880 SF**

**ADU building layout (3 buildings per parcel):**
- Each ADU: **20 ft wide × 22 ft deep = 440 SF footprint × 2 stories = 880 SF**
- Spacing: 20 ft + 6 ft + 20 ft + 6 ft + 20 ft = **72 ft** (exact fit within buildable width)
- Depth: 22 ft building + 18 ft rear access/walkway = 40 ft ✓

**Feasible total: 6 detached two-story ADUs (3 per parcel, ~880 SF each)**

*Note: 420 parcel has 1 protected coast live oak tree (Glendale Indigenous Tree Ordinance, permit BITO1506586). If located in the parking area, it may reduce the 420 side by one ADU. Verify on site visit.*

### Part C: Revenue Projections

**ADU rent basis (new construction in 91202):**

| Comparable | Rent | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Subject 2BR existing (750 SF) | $2,400-$2,650 | 1950s, unrenovated |
| 550 W Stocker renovated 2BR | $2,595-$2,695 | Same street, renovated |
| 618 W Dryden updated 2BR | $2,550-$2,650 | 1 block north |
| **ADU estimate (880 SF, new build)** | **$2,500/mo** | New construction premium, modern finishes |

| Metric | 6 ADUs |
|--------|--------|
| Monthly gross rent | $15,000 (6 × $2,500) |
| Annual gross rent | $180,000 |
| Vacancy (5%) | ($9,000) |
| Operating expenses ($3,500/unit/yr) | ($21,000) |
| **Annual NOI** | **$150,000** |

### Part D: Construction Cost & Timeline

| Component | Per ADU (880 SF) | Total (6 ADUs) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Hard costs ($250/SF) | $220,000 | $1,320,000 |
| Soft costs (15%) | $33,000 | $198,000 |
| Site work & utilities | $15,000 | $90,000 |
| **Total** | **$268,000** | **$1,608,000** |

**Timeline: 12-18 months** (6-9 months permitting + 6-9 months construction)

### Part E: Value Creation & Profit

| Valuation Method | Calculation | Value Created |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Cap rate (5.0%) | $150,000 / 0.050 | **$3,000,000** |
| GRM (15.0×) | $180,000 × 15.0 | **$2,700,000** |
| $/Unit ($339K) | 6 × $339,000 | **$2,034,000** |

| Profit Analysis | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| Value created (at 5% cap) | $3,000,000 |
| Less: Construction cost | ($1,608,000) |
| **Net equity created** | **$1,392,000** |
| **ROI on ADU investment** | **87%** |
| **Cash yield on ADU cost** | **9.3%** ($150K NOI / $1.6M) |

**Impact on combined property (27 + 6 = 33 units at $9.15M + $1.6M = $10.76M all-in):**

| Metric | Before ADUs (27 units) | After ADUs (33 units) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Total NOI (pro forma + ADUs) | $588,498 | $738,498 |
| Value at 5% cap | $11,770,000 | $14,770,000 |
| Cap rate on $10.76M all-in | 5.47% | **6.86%** |

### Part F: ADUs vs. Ground-Up Development — Side-by-Side Comparison

| Factor | ADU Construction (6 units) | Ground-Up Redevelopment (38 units) |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Units added | 6 new | 11 net (38 built - 27 demolished) |
| Approval | Ministerial, 60 days | Discretionary, 12-24 months |
| CEQA | Exempt | Required |
| Tenant displacement | None | All 27 units |
| Relocation costs | $0 | ~$186,000 |
| Lost income during build | $0 (existing units keep producing) | ~$1.84M (4 yrs × $460K) |
| Construction cost | $1.6M | ~$20.4M |
| Total investment | $1.6M | ~$35.4M |
| Timeline | 12-18 months | 4-6 years |
| Completed value added | ~$3.0M | -$13M to -$16M (loss) |
| ROI | **87%** | **Negative** |
| Risk | Low (by-right, proven product) | Extreme (entitlement, cost, market) |

### How to Present in the BOV

**Two standalone BOV sections:**

**Section 1: "Development Potential & Land Value Analysis"**
- Placed in Regulatory & Compliance or as its own section after Transaction History
- Addresses the "land value" question directly with zoning math, cost analysis, and legal citations
- Professional tone — not dismissive, but factual: "While the underlying zoning supports additional density, the current regulatory and economic environment makes ground-up redevelopment impractical"
- Use a `.condition-note` callout summarizing the key barriers

**Section 2: "SB 1211 ADU Development Opportunity"**
- Placed between Rent Comps and Financial Analysis (or as a subsection of Financial Analysis)
- Opens with both aerial images (lot dimensions + parking closeup)
- Key stats callout (`.condition-note`): 6 ADUs by right, $150K/yr NOI, $1.4M profit, 87% ROI
- Setback diagram / layout description
- Financial tables
- Legal citations in smaller text
- Framed as supplemental upside — NOT baked into the base pricing

**For the Financial Analysis section:**
Do NOT incorporate ADU income into the base operating statement or pricing matrix. Present it as **supplemental upside** in a separate callout, showing how ADU income enhances returns at the asking price.

## DEAL TYPING & INVESTMENT THESIS

### Deal Type: **Value-Add (Light to Moderate) + ADU Development Play**

### Investment Thesis

**One-Line Hook:**
> "Stocker Gardens: 27-Unit Side-by-Side Portfolio in Prime North Glendale with $138K Rent Upside, SB 1211 ADU Potential for 6 Additional Units ($150K NOI), 6.43% Pro Forma Cap, and 1.1-Acre Combined Site"

**Why This Asset Wins:**
1. **Rare scale in prime 91202:** Two adjacent parcels totaling 27 units across 5 buildings on 1.12 acres — unusual size for this submarket
2. **Significant rent upside:** $137,532/yr from scheduled to potential rent ($740,748 → $878,280), plus parking upside
3. **SB 1211 ADU development potential:** Rear parking area (~8,000 SF) can accommodate 6 detached two-story ADUs by right with ministerial approval. Projected $150,000/yr additional NOI on ~$1.6M investment (87% ROI). No tenant displacement, no CEQA, no replacement parking required. Combined pro forma cap pushes to 7.82%.
4. **Strong pro forma returns:** 6.43% pro forma cap rate (before ADU income); with 6 ADUs, pushes above 7.8%
5. **Recent capital investment:** Owner spent $117K in 2024 CapEx alone (plumbing, deck, windows, HVAC) — reduces buyer's near-term capital needs
6. **Same-street comp validation:** 617 W Stocker (9 units) sold at $394K/unit — subject at $339K/unit is a value entry point
7. **Unique front house:** 4BR/3BA Craftsman at 2,500 SF — differentiator not found in typical apartment deals
8. **Excess zoning capacity:** R-1250 zoning (to be confirmed) allows ~38 units vs. 27 existing, with FAR capacity for ~58,000 SF vs. 22,674 SF — long-term development optionality
9. **Long-term ownership (34+ years):** Signals desirable, low-turnover tenant base and neighborhood stability

**Target Buyer Profile:**
- **1031 Exchange Investor:** Needs large, quality asset to park equity; 91202 is institutional-quality zip code. Immediate cash flow with layered upside.
- **Value-Add Operator with ADU Strategy:** Can push rents to market ($138K upside) AND build 6 ADUs in the back parking area ($150K/yr additional NOI). Total value creation potential of ~$3M on ~$1.6M investment.
- **Local Operator:** Can self-manage, push rents to market, and capture $138K+ upside within 12-24 months before pursuing ADU construction.
- **Family Office / Long-Term Hold:** Premier Glendale location with generational hold appeal. Excess zoning capacity provides optionality for future densification.

**Key Pricing Support:**
- $9.15M list price = 5.03% current cap / 6.43% pro forma cap
- $339K/unit vs 617 Stocker comp at $394K/unit (14% discount — room for appreciation)
- Trade range: $8.65M-$9.65M

## GAP LOG

### Resolved
| Item | Resolution |
|------|-----------|
| Unit count & SF | 27 units, 22,674 SF — confirmed via database and pricing model |
| Unit sizes | 2BR: 750 SF, 1BR: 650 SF, House: 2,500 SF — per database/model |
| Front house rent estimate | $5,000/mo in model ($4,500 conservative research) |
| Pricing & underwriting | $9.15M list, $460K current NOI, $588K pro forma — per pricing model |
| Tax reassessment | $103,395 modeled (vs seller $49,300) — correctly normalized |
| Expense normalization | 4% mgmt fee, $24K on-site manager, $5,400 reserves added |
| **ADU potential (SB 1211)** | **Up to 16 detached ADUs (8 per parcel) legally. Physical site analysis: 6 two-story ADUs fit in back parking (3 per parcel). $150K/yr NOI on $1.6M investment. 87% ROI.** |
| **Development density** | **R-1250 allows 38 units max (at 80 ft lot width, no wide-lot bonus). Only +11 over 27 existing. Full rebuild impractical; ADUs are the executable path.** |
| **Glendale zoning framework** | **Glendale uses R-1250/R-1650/etc. "GLR4YY" is an assessor use code, not city zoning. Height limit 2 stories/26 ft for lots ≤90 ft wide.** |
| **Lot dimensions** | **Each lot: 80 ft × 300 ft. Combined: 160 ft × 300 ft. Rear parking area: ~50 ft × 160 ft (~8,000 SF). Lot width 80 ft < 90 ft threshold.** |
| **ADU height/stories** | **18 ft / 2 stories confirmed by right under Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(D)(iii) for lots with existing multistory multifamily. State law preempts Glendale's 16 ft local limit.** |
