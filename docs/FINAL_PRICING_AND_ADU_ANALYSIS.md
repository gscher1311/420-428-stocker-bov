## FINALIZED PRICING STRUCTURE

| Component | List Price | Sale Floor | Range |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Apartment value (income-based) | $9,000,000 | $8,650,000 | $8,650,000 - $9,000,000 |
| ADU premium (optionality) | $350,000 | $200,000 | $200,000 - $350,000 |
| **Suggested list price** | **$9,350,000** | **$8,850,000** | **$8,850,000 - $9,350,000** |

**Apartment value basis:** 5.00% cap on $449,791 normalized current NOI (per PDF pricing model). Sale floor at 5.25% cap ($8,650,000).

**ADU premium basis:** $200K-$350K represents 22-39% of the realistic ~$896K ADU development profit. Even at the full $350K list premium, the buyer retains $546K of profit at 33% ROI -- a compelling investment. Premium also justified by scarcity (1.1-acre lot with 8,000 SF buildable rear area) and certainty (SB 1211 by-right ministerial approval).

## PRICING MATRIX (Tax-Adjusted: Property Taxes = 1.13% of Price)

**IMPORTANT:** Property taxes change with price (1.13% of sale price per Glendale assessment). This means NOI changes at every price point. The matrix below reflects this correctly.

**Fixed inputs:**
- Current EGI: $709,531
- Pro Forma EGI: $840,186
- GSR: $740,748
- Non-tax current expenses: $158,040
- Non-tax pro forma expenses: $163,266
- Tax rate: 1.13% of price

**Formula:** Taxes = Price x 0.0113 | Current NOI = $709,531 - ($158,040 + Taxes) | PF NOI = $840,186 - ($163,266 + Taxes)

| Price | Taxes | Cur NOI | PF NOI | $/Unit | $/SF | Cur Cap | PF Cap | GRM |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|--------|------|---------|--------|-----|
| $9,750,000 | $110,175 | $441,316 | $566,745 | $361,111 | $430 | 4.53% | 5.81% | 13.16 |

- **$8,850,000** = Sale floor (apartment floor + ADU floor premium)
- $9,000,000 = Apartment income value (5.00% cap)
- $8,650,000 = Apartment sale floor (5.25% cap)

## APARTMENT VALUATION SUPPORT (4-Method Analysis)

### How $9.0M Is Supported by Comps

| Metric | Subject @$9M | Comp Median | Position |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| $/Unit | $333,333 | $382,000 | 13% below -- value entry point |
| $/SF | $396.93 | $407 | 2% below -- at market |
| Cap Rate | 5.00% | 4.84% | 16 bps above -- more yield |
| GRM | 12.15 | 13.57 | 10% below -- tighter multiple |

**Primary anchors:**
- 617 W Stocker (same street): $394K/unit → subject at $333K is 15% below = appropriate for 3x scale + older vintage
- 950 N Louise (best size match, 25u): $370K/unit → subject at $333K is 10% below = appropriate for premium location/condition of comp
- Market cap range: 4.38%-5.17% → subject at 5.00% is above median, delivers more yield

**Conclusion:** $9.0M is well-supported as apartment income value. Conservative on $/unit, at-market on $/SF, above-market yield on cap rate.

## ADU PREMIUM JUSTIFICATION ($200K - $350K)

### ADU Development Economics (Corrected, Final)

**6 detached 2-story ADUs, 880 SF each, in rear parking area (~50 ft x 160 ft)**

| Assumption | Optimistic | **Realistic** | Conservative |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Cost/unit (all-in + site + contingency) | $250,000 | **$275,000** | $325,000 |
| Total cost (6 units) | $1,500,000 | **$1,650,000** | $1,950,000 |
| Rent/unit/mo | $2,400 | **$2,300** | $2,200 |
| Annual gross (6 units) | $172,800 | **$165,600** | $158,400 |
| Vacancy (5%) | ($8,640) | **($8,280)** | ($7,920) |
| OpEx/unit/yr | $4,500 | **$5,000** | $5,500 |
| Total OpEx (6) | ($27,000) | **($30,000)** | ($33,000) |
| **ADU NOI** | **$137,160** | **$127,320** | **$117,480** |
| Value at 5% cap | $2,743,200 | $2,546,400 | $2,349,600 |
| **Profit** | **$1,243,200** | **$896,400** | **$399,600** |
| **ROI** | **83%** | **54%** | **20%** |

**Construction cost breakdown (realistic, $275K/unit):**

| Component | Per ADU | 6 ADUs |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| All-in construction ($275/SF x 880 SF) | $242,000 | $1,452,000 |
| Shared site work (demo parking, grading, utility mains) | $10,000 | $60,000 |
| Contingency (10%) | $25,000 | $150,000 |
| **Total** | **~$277,000** | **~$1,662,000** |

*Economies of scale: 6 identical units built simultaneously = shared mobilization, one set of plans, bulk materials, repeat crew efficiency. Per-unit cost at lower end of the $200-$350/SF market range for LA-area ADUs.*

### How the Premium Splits the Profit

| Premium | % of Realistic Profit ($896K) | Buyer Keeps | Buyer ROI After Premium |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **$200K (sale floor)** | 22% | $696K | 42% |
| $275K (midpoint) | 31% | $621K | 38% |
| **$350K (list price)** | 39% | $546K | 33% |

**At every point in the range, the buyer retains a compelling return.** Even at the full $350K list premium, the buyer keeps $546K of profit and earns 33% ROI on their ADU investment.

### Alternative Premium Justification: Optionality & Scarcity

The premium doesn't require agreeing on specific construction costs. It's the price of owning a rare option:

1. **Scarcity:** Very few 27-unit Glendale properties have 8,000 SF of vacant buildable land. This is a genuinely rare physical attribute.
2. **By-right certainty:** SB 1211 = ministerial approval, 60 days, no CEQA, no public hearing. The entitlement risk is near zero.
3. **Flexibility:** Build 1, 2, 3, or 6 ADUs. Build now or in 5 years. No expiration date.
4. **Market norm:** Properties with identified ADU/development potential trade at 3-5% premiums in LA metro. $350K / $9.0M = 3.9% -- right in that range.

## GROUND-UP DEVELOPMENT: WHY IT DOESN'T WORK

*For the BOV section addressing the seller's "land value" belief.*

### Zoning Limits

| Zoning | Max Units | Current | Net Gain | Source |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| R-1250 (confirmed per 950 Louise MLS) | 38 | 27 | +11 | GMC §30.11.030 |
| Height (80 ft lot width < 90 ft) | 2 stories / 26 ft | 2 stories | No change | GMC §30.11.030 |

**You'd tear down 27 to build 38 -- a net gain of only 11 units.**

### Economics: $13-16M Loss

| Item | Amount | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| Land (at $9.0M) | $9,000,000 | Apartment income value |
| Demolition | ~$200,000 | Industry estimate |
| Hard construction (38u x $430K) | $16,340,000 | RAND Corp. April 2025 |
| Soft costs (25%) | $4,085,000 | RAND 2025 |
| Municipal fees (38 x $29K) | $1,102,000 | RAND 2025 |
| Tenant relocation (27u x 3 mo rent) | ~$186,000 | Glendale Ord. 5922 |
| Lost income (4 yrs x $449,791) | $1,799,164 | Current NOI |
| Financing carry | ~$2,450,000 | Estimated |
| **Total cost** | **~$35,160,000** | |
| **Completed value (4.5% cap on ~$889K NOI)** | **~$19,760,000** | |
| **Loss** | **~($15,400,000)** | |

### Legal Barriers (5 Laws)

1. **SB 330 (Housing Crisis Act):** No net loss of units. All 27 must be replaced at same affordability. No demo permit until replacement agreement recorded. *(Gov. Code §66300(d)(2))*
2. **Ellis Act / AB 1399:** Property-wide withdrawal. Re-renting any unit forces entire property back at prior rents. *(Gov. Code §7060.2(b))*
3. **Glendale Ord. 5922:** Just cause eviction required. 3 months' rent relocation per unit. *(§9.30.025)*
4. **CEQA:** Environmental review required for 38-unit project.
5. **SB 423:** Even streamlined approval requires affordable set-asides.

### Bottom Line

Development potential is theoretical only. It contributes zero premium to the current price. The practical value-add is ADU infill, not demolition.

## ADU LEGAL FRAMEWORK (SB 1211)

### Key Provisions

| Provision | Rule | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Detached ADUs per lot | Up to 8 (capped at existing unit count) | SB 1211; Gov. Code §66323(a)(4) |
| Size per ADU | 850-1,200 SF | Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(B) |
| Height | 18 ft (2 stories) on lots with multistory MF | Gov. Code §66321(c)(2)(D)(iii) |
| Setbacks | 4 ft side and rear from lot lines | Gov. Code §66323(a)(4) |
| Building separation | ~6 ft (CA Building Code, Type V) | CBC Table 602 |
| Parking replacement | Not required | SB 1211; Gov. Code §66323(a)(4)(B) |
| Approval | Ministerial, 60-day timeline | Gov. Code §66321(a)(3) |
| Owner occupancy | Not required | AB 976 |

### Legal Maximum (Two Parcels)

| | 420 Parcel (9 units) | 428 Parcel (18 units) | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detached ADU cap | 8 | 8 | **16** |
| Conversion ADU cap | 2 | 4 | **6** |
| **Legal maximum** | **10** | **12** | **22** |

### Physical Feasibility: 6 ADUs

**Rear parking area:** ~50 ft deep x 160 ft wide = ~8,000 SF

**Net buildable per parcel (after setbacks):**
- Width: 80 ft - 4 ft (side) - 4 ft (interior lot line) = 72 ft
- Depth: 50 ft - 4 ft (rear) - 6 ft (building separation) = 40 ft
- Per parcel: 72 ft x 40 ft = 2,880 SF

**Layout: 3 buildings per parcel**
- Each: 20 ft wide x 22 ft deep x 2 stories = 880 SF
- Spacing: 20 + 6 + 20 + 6 + 20 = 72 ft (exact fit)
- Depth: 22 ft building + 18 ft rear access = 40 ft

**Feasible total: 6 detached 2-story ADUs (3 per parcel)**

**Site note:** Protected coast live oak on 420 parcel may reduce by 1 ADU. Verify on site visit.
