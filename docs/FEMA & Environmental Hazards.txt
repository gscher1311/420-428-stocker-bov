## FEMA FLOOD ZONE

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Flood Zone | Zone X (shaded) |
| Definition | Area of moderate flood hazard — between the 100-year and 500-year flood limits |
| FIRM Panel | 06037C1345F |
| Effective Date | September 26, 2008 |
| Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)? | NO — Zone X (shaded) is NOT an SFHA |
| Flood Insurance Required? | NO — federally required flood insurance only applies to SFHA zones (A, AE, V, etc.) |
| Flood Insurance Recommended? | Optional — moderate risk area; some lenders may recommend but not require |

### What Zone X (Shaded) Means
- Between the 100-year (1% annual chance) and 500-year (0.2% annual chance) flood boundaries
- Lower risk than Zone A, AE, V, or VE designations
- Most conventional lenders do NOT require flood insurance
- Properties in this zone have a lower but non-negligible flood risk

## SEISMIC / EARTHQUAKE

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone | Not on known active fault trace |
| Seismic Zone | Standard Southern California seismic region |
| Liquefaction Risk | Low to moderate — flat terrain, alluvial area typical for Glendale valley floor |
| Landslide Risk | Low — flat area, not hillside |

---

## FIRE HAZARD

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ) | NO — flat North Glendale, not hillside |
| Wildfire Risk | Low — urban flat area well away from wildland-urban interface |
| Confirmed by | 2012 roofing permits for 420 Stocker state "Not in high fire hazard zone" |

## SOFT-STORY RETROFIT STATUS

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Glendale Mandatory Soft-Story Ordinance | DOES NOT EXIST — Glendale does not have a mandatory program |
| Status as of May 2019 | Voluntary only — city was "working on mandating" per retrofit1.com |
| Current Status (Feb 2026) | No mandatory ordinance found — check with B&S for updates |
| Subject Property Risk | 1953/1954 wood frame — potentially soft-story if tuck-under parking exists |
| No Retrofit Permits on File | No soft-story retrofit permits found for either parcel |
| Recommendation | Buyer should evaluate seismic vulnerability voluntarily; no city mandate to comply with |

### Context: LA vs Glendale
- City of Los Angeles has a MANDATORY soft-story retrofit program (Ordinances 183893 & 184081)
- Glendale does NOT — this is a distinction that matters for buyer due diligence
- A buyer may still want to budget for voluntary seismic retrofit as a risk mitigation measure

## AIRPORT PROXIMITY

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Nearest Airport | Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR) — ~3 miles NW |
| Airport Influence Area | Possibly in airport influence area — verify with airport land use commission |
| Noise Impact | Moderate — flight path may produce some noise depending on wind patterns |

---

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| DTSC (Dept. of Toxic Substances Control) | No sites identified at this location |
| GeoTracker (State Water Resources) | No sites identified at this location |
| Phase I ESA | Not yet completed — to be verified in formal environmental assessment |
| Known Contamination | None identified from available records |
